# Campaign Monitor Silverstripe Module
## Overview
Adds a page type and a couple form fields to the SiteConfig tab within Silverstripe to make it easy to add Campaign Monitor Form pages. Currently in it's initial state, there's some UI work that needs to be done to make it easier to select your list, etc.

## Notice
This has only been tested with versions of Silverstripe 2.3+, *not* including 3.0. I'm working currently to update it as needed to fit into the new SS 3.0 Module framework.

## CM List IDs
Also note, Campaign Monitor has regular list IDs (which you see in the normal dashboard), and API List IDs, which are the ones you need. To get these drill into the list details itself (hit 'Change name/type' on the list view page) and you'll see the API Subscriber List ID at the bottom.
